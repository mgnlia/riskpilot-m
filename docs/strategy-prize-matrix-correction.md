# Mistral 2026 Strategy Correction — Prize Track Matrix

## Critical correction (from audit)
Previous strategy incorrectly treated **Best Use of Agent Skills** as a cash prize.

### Corrected understanding
- **Best Use of Agent Skills**: **Custom Reachy Mini robot** (non-cash physical prize)
- **Global Winner**: **$10,000 cash + $15,000 credits**
- **Online 1st place**: **$1,500 cash + $3,000 credits**
- **Best Use of ElevenLabs**: **$2,000 credits per team member**

## Reprioritized objective order
1. **Primary**: Global Winner (max cash + credits)
2. **Primary**: Online Podium (especially 1st place cash + credits)
3. **Secondary**: Best Use of ElevenLabs (credits leverage)
4. **Optional/brand**: Best Use of Agent Skills (robot, non-cash)

## Execution implication
- Optimize submission narrative and demo for overall winner criteria and online podium competitiveness.
- Treat Agent Skills integration as a feature enhancer, not the central value target.
