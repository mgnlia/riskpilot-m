### Questions to capture at briefing
1. Submission portal URL and format (Devpost/form/other)?
2. Is an unlisted video URL mandatory? Max length and accepted hosts?
3. Required links: GitHub repo, live demo URL, architecture diagram?
4. Team registration constraints: wallet verification, team size, invite/approval steps?
5. Any judging constraints for online demos (must be deployed vs local run accepted)?
