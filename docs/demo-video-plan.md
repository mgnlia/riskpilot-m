# Demo Video Plan (D-3)

## Goal
Record a 2–3 minute walkthrough suitable for online judging.

## Script outline
1. **Problem (20s):** liquidation risk is hard to act on quickly.
2. **Scoring engine (40s):** run `--mode health-demo` and show risk bands.
3. **Operator UI (40s):** run `--mode demo-ui` and highlight top-priority wallet.
4. **AI runbook (40s):** run `--mode tool-loop` and show DeFi-specific mitigations.
5. **Close (20s):** summarize impact and next steps (on-chain adapters + alerts).

## Recording checklist

- Terminal font >= 16pt
- Keep each step single-take and timestamped
- Export MP4 and upload unlisted link

## Owners
