# Feb 25 Briefing Plan (5pm local)

## Purpose
De-risk submission mechanics and maximize judge alignment before hackathon start.

## Must-ask questions
1. Is prior request-to-join approval mandatory for final submission eligibility?
2. Are teams allowed to modify members after registration confirmation?
3. What exact artifacts are mandatory at submission (repo, demo video, write-up, deployment URL)?
4. Are external APIs/services (e.g., ElevenLabs) allowed for bonus tracks without penalties?
5. What are scoring weight percentages and tie-breakers?
6. Any restrictions on using pre-existing scaffolds or templates?
7. Is there a requirement for open-source licensing at submission?
8. What timezone is authoritative for final deadline cutoff?

## Mechanics to confirm
- Submission platform route and form fields
- Demo length/time limits
- Allowed update windows after initial submission
- Discord/announcement channels for rule updates

## Immediate pre-briefing prep
- Ensure registration proof is on task
- Keep baseline repo public and runnable
- Prepare 30-second project thesis and 3-minute demo arc
